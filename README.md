# This project was made in one of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's courses, and was created using React.

This project helped understand a little deeply how to securely fetch data from an API.

Also touched a little in the 'useCallback' hook, and some other minor things.

I plan on furthering the project beyond the course's scope in a future, but right now is in pause.

_Project on Hold_
